# EVNTZ

#### üöÄ Introduction

EVNTZ is an agnostic digital platform designed to seamlessly integrate with existing web2 ticketing systems, leveraging the power of tokenization and sophisticated security mechanisms in the Internet Computer Protocol, transforming the way event tickets are issued.

EVNTZ, built on the Internet Computer Protocol Blockchain, aims to revolutionize the event ticketing industry by eliminating fraud and scalping through the use of digitization and smart contract canisters. It offers customizable features like royalty divisions and price limitations, enabling artists and organizers to control revenue from potential resales and mitigate the effects of ticket scalping. NFT tickets can be programmed with price limitations or designated as non-transferable, ensuring fairness and security. The platform integrates with web2 ticketing systems, providing control, traceability, transparency, and integrity to artists and customers. EVNTZ's responsive web application allows users to access the platform from any device. The open-source code ensures transparency and auditability. Users can transfer tickets securely, preventing fraudulent activities. Business rules and algorithms incorporate historical data to detect illicit actions and enhance security. EVNTZ fosters stronger connections between artists, fans, event organizers, and brands, creating immersive and engaging experiences.
